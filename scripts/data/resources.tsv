exRNA	(from Common Fund website) The Extracellular RNA Communication (ERC) program is exploring the biology of extracellular RNA (exRNA).	1	/static/resources/exrna.png
Glycoscience	(from Common Fund website) The goal of the Common Fund’s Glycoscience program is to create new resources, tools, and method to make the study of glycans (sugars) more accessible to the broader research community.	2	/static/resources/glycoscience.png
GTEx	(from Common Fund website) The Common Fund's Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Program established a data resource and tissue bank to study the relationship between genetic variants (inherited changes in DNA sequence) and gene expression (how genes are turned on and off) in multiple human tissues and across individuals.	3	/static/resources/gtex.png
HMP	(from Common Fund website) The Common Fund's Human Microbiome Project (HMP) developed research resources to enable the study of the microbial communities that live in and on our bodies and the roles they play in human health and disease.	4	/static/resources/HMP.png
HuBMAP	(from Common Fund website) The goal of the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is to develop an open and global platform to map healthy cells in the human body.	5	/static/resources/hubmap.png
IDG	(from Common Fund website) The overall goal of the IDG Program is to catalyze research in areas of biology that are currently understudied but that have high potential to impact human health.	6	/static/resources/idg.png
Kids First	(from Common Fund website) The goal of the Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) is to help researchers uncover new insights into the biology of childhood cancer and structural birth defects, including the discovery of shared genetic pathways between these disorders.	7	/static/resources/kidsfirst.png
LINCS	(from Common Fund website) The Common Fund’s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program is developing a library that catalogs changes that occur when different types of cells are exposed to a variety of agents that disrupt normal cellular functions, called “perturbagens.”	8	/static/resources/lincs.gif
Metabolomics	(from Common Fund website) The goal of the Common Fund’s Metabolomics program is to inform basic, translational, and clinical research.	9	/static/resources/metabolomics.png
MoTrPAC	"(from their website) MoTrPAC is a national research consortium designed to discover and perform preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers (the ""molecular map"") that underlie the effects of physical activity in humans. The program's goal is to study the molecular changes that occur during and after exercise and ultimately to advance the understanding of how physical activity improves and preserves health."	10	/static/resources/motrpac.png
SPARC	(from Common Fund website) The Common Fund’s Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC) program accelerates development of therapeutic devices that modulate electrical activity in nerves to improve organ function.	11	/static/resources/sparc.png
CFDE	(from Common Fund website) The Common Fund is developing a data ecosystem (Common Fund Data Ecosystem, CFDE) where Common Fund datasets will be stored in the digital cloud environment.	12	/static/icons/CFDE-logo.png
